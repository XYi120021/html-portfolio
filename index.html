    <h2>Summary:</h2>
    <p>
        A self-driven professional transitioning into IT freelancing with a strong foundation in project management and customer service. As a former Project Subject Matter Expert, I honed my ability to manage client relationships, deliver solutions, and meet deadlines. I have since expanded my skill set through self-directed learning in web development, mastering HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Google Apps Script. Now, I am offering freelance web development services, focusing on creating responsive and user-friendly websites that help businesses enhance their online presence and efficiency.
